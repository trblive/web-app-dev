Installing and setting up Tailwind CSS in a Next.js project:

# Setting Up Tailwind CSS in our NASA API Next.js Project

## 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
````

## 2. Create Tailwind and PostCSS Configuration Files

Initialize Tailwind CSS to generate the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```javascript
// postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: ["tailwindcss", "autoprefixer"],
};
```

## 3. Configure Your CSS File

Assuming you have a `global.css` file in your `styles` directory, import Tailwind CSS directives into this file:

```css
/* styles/global.css */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Your custom CSS rules can go here */
```

## 4. Integrate with Next.js

In your `_app.js` or `_app.tsx` file under the `pages` directory, import your `global.css` file to ensure it's applied globally across your Next.js application:

```javascript
// pages/_app.js

import "../styles/global.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

## 5. Run the Development Server

After setting everything up, run your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Tailwind CSS classes should now be available for use throughout your project. You can start adding Tailwind CSS classes to your components.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies (`tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`, `postcss`) as devDependencies in your `package.json` file.
- Run `npx tailwindcss init` to generate a `tailwind.config.js` file if it doesn't exist. You can customize this file based on your project's needs.
